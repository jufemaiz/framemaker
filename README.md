# Frame Maker

Sick and tired of sketching on paper the calculations to take a length of frame material and account for matting to make a frame, thought I'd make my life easier.

## TODO

* Sinatraise
* Coffeescript
* Prettify
* History / Auto load
* Image option for the picture you want to frame
* Colour picker for frame/matt
* Optional increase of number of matts
* Non-uniform matting
